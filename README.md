# GixTheGoblin
Console Line Game
Player leads Gix through a series of up to 5 combats.
Limited EP (energy point) pool can be used to Bite and Lick Wounds.
Surviving all 5 encounters means victory.

Tests, equipment, and logging player scores are things that I wish to implement in the future.
I have laid some foundation for each but have not found much time to keep pursuing this project while learning at Tech Elevator.
